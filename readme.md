## Overview

The **Kessler Syndrome Early Warning System (SSA-EWS)** is an end-to-end, cloud-native data engineering pipeline that brings real Space Situational Awareness capability down to a student budget. It ingests live orbital telemetry from three independent public aerospace APIs, converts raw Two-Line Element (TLE) data into geocentric Cartesian coordinates using the **SGP4/SDP4 propagation model**, and runs a **225-million-row pairwise distance computation** on a serverless cloud data warehouse to detect satellite conjunction (near-collision) events.

The entire pipeline is orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions**, triggered nightly by **EventBridge**, and requires zero manual intervention. When a critical conjunction is detected, the system automatically:

1. Scores the collision probability (Pc) using a SageMaker XGBoost model
2. Projects both satellites' trajectories 72 hours forward
3. Computes the optimal avoidance maneuver window
4. Fires an **SNS email alert**
5. Surfaces everything on a live, mission-control-style web dashboard

> Named after the 1978 Kessler Syndrome hypothesis (Kessler & Cour-Palais), which predicted that orbital debris density in LEO could reach a tipping point of cascading collisions. This project is a small, quantitative attempt to monitor that tipping point in near-real-time.

## System Architecture

The pipeline follows a modern **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** pattern across five logical layers, each implemented with a dedicated AWS service. The architecture is fully event-driven: a nightly EventBridge cron trigger fires a Step Functions state machine that orchestrates each stage sequentially, with parallel extraction at the start.

## Data Sources

Three independent Lambda functions run in **parallel**, each targeting a distinct public aerospace API. Raw outputs land in S3 under `bronze/`, partitioned by `run_date`.

### 1. CelesTrak Active Satellite Catalogue

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Source | CelesTrak / US DoD Space Surveillance Network |
| Endpoint | `celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=tle` |
| Format | Fixed-width TLE text (69 chars/line) |
| Volume | 15,008 active satellite records |
| S3 destination | `s3://<bucket>/bronze/satellites/run_date=YYYY-MM-DD/raw.txt` |
| Lambda | `ssa-extract-celestrak`, 256 MB, 60s timeout |

TLE fields are extracted using exact character-index slices:

```python
name  = raw_text[i].strip()
line1 = raw_text[i+1].strip()
line2 = raw_text[i+2].strip()

sat_number   = line1[2:7].strip()    # NORAD catalogue ID
inclination  = line2[8:16].strip()   # degrees from equatorial plane
eccentricity = line2[26:33].strip()  # encoded without decimal point
mean_motion  = line2[52:63].strip()  # revolutions per day
```

## Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)

### Silver Layer: Transformation Engine

A **Glue PySpark** job reads raw TLE text from `bronze/`, applies **SGP4 orbital propagation** via the [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) library, and outputs each satellite's geocentric Cartesian position (ECI frame) to `silver/`.

TLE data encodes orbital *shape and orientation*, not physical location. To compute the distance between two satellites at a given instant, both must be expressed in a common Cartesian reference frame. SGP4 numerically integrates the equations of motion forward from the TLE epoch to the current time.

```python
from skyfield.api import load, EarthSatellite
import numpy as np

ts = load.timescale()
t = ts.now()  # propagate to current UTC

for row in satellite_df.itertuples():
    try:
        sat = EarthSatellite(row.line1, row.line2, row.name, ts)
        pos = sat.at(t).position.km  # [X_km, Y_km, Z_km] ECI frame
        if np.isnan(pos[0]):
            raise ValueError("SGP4 math domain error")
        good.append({**row, "x_km": pos[0], "y_km": pos[1], "z_km": pos[2]})
    except Exception as e:
        quarantine.append({**row, "reason": str(e)})  # audited separately
```

**Data Quality, Quarantine Layer:** TLE records that produce `NaN` positions (decayed satellites still present in the public catalogue) are routed to a separate quarantine path instead of being silently discarded. A CloudWatch custom metric tracks the quarantine rate per run.

| Output | S3 Path | Format | Typical Volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clean records | `silver/satellites_xyz/run_date=.../part-*.parquet` | Parquet | ~14,800 records |
| Quarantined | `silver/quarantine/run_date=.../bad_tles.json` | JSON | ~200 records |

A **Glue Crawler** runs after the job completes, scanning `silver/satellites_xyz/` and registering the schema into the `ssa_silver` Glue Data Catalog database, making the table immediately queryable from Athena without manual DDL.

## Core Computation: 225M-Row Cross-Join

### The Computational Challenge

Assessing collision risk requires comparing **every satellite against every other satellite simultaneously**. With 15,008 objects, the total number of unique ordered pairs is `N x (N-1) = 225,240,056` comparisons. Loading this Cartesian product into local RAM would require tens of gigabytes, so the computation is delegated entirely to **Amazon Athena**, which executes the query against columnar Parquet files in S3 using distributed compute. The `WHERE` clause filtering to `< 50 km` means the materialised output contains only ~586 rows despite the 225-million-row intermediate.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ssa_gold.fact_collision_risks
WITH (format = 'PARQUET',
      location = 's3://<bucket>/gold/fact_collision_risks/')
AS
SELECT
    a.satellite_name AS target_sat,
    b.satellite_name AS threat_sat,
    SQRT( POW(a.x_km - b.x_km, 2)
        + POW(a.y_km - b.y_km, 2)
        + POW(a.z_km - b.z_km, 2) ) AS distance_km,
    CASE
        WHEN dist < 10 THEN 'CRITICAL'
        WHEN dist < 30 THEN 'CAUTION'
        ELSE                'SAFE'
    END AS risk_level
FROM   ssa_silver.satellites_xyz a
JOIN   ssa_silver.satellites_xyz b
    ON a.satellite_number != b.satellite_number
WHERE  SQRT( POW(a.x_km-b.x_km,2) + POW(a.y_km-b.y_km,2) + POW(a.z_km-b.z_km,2) ) < 50
ORDER  BY distance_km ASC;
```

## Prediction, Alert and Recommendation Layer

Detection alone is insufficient for an *operational* warning system. This layer extends every **CRITICAL** conjunction event with a physics-based collision probability score, a 72-hour forward trajectory projection, and a computed avoidance maneuver window.

### Collision Probability Scoring (`ssa-score-risk`)

A **SageMaker XGBoost** model is trained on historical TLE epoch pairs. Features include miss distance, relative orbital velocity (derived from TLE mean-motion difference), inclination delta, altitude band, and eccentricity. The model outputs a collision probability score **Pc** (0-1) per conjunction pair. The model artifact is exported to S3 and loaded inside a Lambda for batch inference, avoiding any persistent SageMaker endpoint cost.

| Risk Level | Distance Threshold | Dashboard Indicator | Action Triggered |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | < 10 km | Flashing red badge | SNS email + Recommendation written |
| CAUTION | 10-30 km | Amber badge | Dashboard highlight only |
| SAFE | 30-50 km | Green badge | No action |

### 72-Hour Trajectory Propagation (`ssa-propagate-72hr`)

For every CRITICAL pair, the Lambda propagates both satellites' positions forward in 3-hour steps for 72 hours using a **vis-viva orbital mechanics approximation**, identifying the predicted closest-approach hour and the optimal maneuver window (max separation within the first 24 hours, minimising the delta-V required for an avoidance burn).

```python
# Vis-viva velocity approximation (tangential, ECI frame)
def approx_velocity(x, y, z):
    r = sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    v = sqrt(398600 / r)  # km/s, Earth GM = 398600 km^3/s^2
    return (-y/r * v, x/r * v, 0.0)

# Propagate forward in 3-hour steps
for h in range(0, 73, 3):
    px = x + vx * 3600 * h
    py = y + vy * 3600 * h
    dist = sqrt((px-qx)**2 + (py-qy)**2 + (pz-qz)**2)
```

Output is written to both the `Trajectories72hr` and `Recommendations` DynamoDB tables, and exposed via the `/recommendations` API endpoint.

### Automated Alert via SNS Email

The Step Functions **Choice** state evaluates `critical_count` from the compute stage output. If greater than zero, it invokes the alert Lambda, which publishes to an SNS topic:

> **Sample Recommendation Output**
> Optimal maneuver window at T+12hr when separation is 45.2 km. Closest approach predicted at T+6hr (0.0025 km). Execute delta-V burn before T+0hr.
> `[Target: COSMOS-2251 | Threat: IRIDIUM-33 | Pc: 0.61]`

## Limitations

- The conjunction analysis uses **instantaneous positional snapshots**. Operational SSA uses covariance-based Probability of Collision (Pc) calculations accounting for full positional uncertainty ellipsoids; this project uses a simplified Gaussian miss-distance Pc model.
- The 72-hour trajectory propagation uses a **constant-velocity tangential approximation** rather than full multi-step SGP4 integration. For high-eccentricity or high-drag orbits, this diverges from the true trajectory after approximately 12 hours.
- Zero-distance readings for co-located station modules (ISS, CSS) should be filtered using a docking registry grouped by COSPAR base designator.
- The system depends on three external public APIs with **no retry logic or schema validation** beyond basic exception handling.
- Solar-drag correlation analysis (NOAA X-ray flux vs. average LEO altitude decay) was designed but not implemented in the current pipeline run.

---

## Future Work

- [ ] Implement full multi-step SGP4 propagation over 72 hours for accurate trajectory forecasting
- [ ] Add covariance matrix integration (Alfriend or Foster methods) for operational Pc values
- [ ] Build a Three.js 3D orbital globe visualisation rendering live satellite positions
- [ ] Extend ingestion to uncatalogued debris from radar observation networks
- [ ] Implement the solar-drag correlation dashboard panel using NOAA flux history
